.
Presentation

also
good
source
to
refer
.
lf
you

Lectures
be
good
.
understandable
.
the
lecture
slide
be
well
organize
and
the
example
do
in
the
class
help
a
lot
to
learn
this
new
language
and
also
the
principle
of
OOP
.
Motivated
to
well
.
will
have
be
good
if
we
discuss
more
about
the
solution
of
coding
exerciser
.
I
think
i
learn
a
lot
from
the
code
you
write
in
the
board
.
when
i
compare
my
code
with
yours
i
can
learn
about
my
mistake
and
good
coding
practice
that
i
should
follow
.
there
fore
i
think
it
will
be
great
if
we
can
discuss
much
example
in
the
class
.
madam
explain
the
oop
concept
clearly
with
examples.lectures
be
interesting.we
want
much
scenario
example
and
answer
with
explanation
in
future
.
I
satisfy
about
first
7
lecture
.
that
way
of
teaching
be
really
good
for
come
lecture
too
.
lectuers
be
very
good
.
take
good
effort
to
make
undersatand
every
student
in
the
room
.
very
helpfull
.
I
be
able
to
obtain
a
clear
picture
about
OOP
and
its
concept
.
``
lecture
slide
,
explanation
be
very
clear
.
<br />
it
&#039;
s
very
good
to
let
ask
question
and
explain
again
with
suitable
example
.
<br />
sometimes
,
some
code
on
white
board
be
unclear
at
the
back
.
<br />
overall
very
good
!!!
<br />
''
the
lecture
be
good
and
clear
.
and
they
weren
&#039;
t
too
fast
.
write
code
be
somewhat
confusing
because
I
didn
&#039;
t
know
java
before
.
actually
teaching
be
very
good
and
can
understand
easily
the
concept
by
example
which
be
give
in
the
class.it
will
be
more
helpful
if
provide
solve
question
as
well
!
.
thankyou
