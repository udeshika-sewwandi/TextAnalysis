The

the

a
lot
to
learn
thi
new
languag
and
also
the
principl
of
OOP
.
Motiv
to
well
.
Would
have
been
better
if
we

more
about
the
solut
of
code
exercis
.
I
think
i
learn
a
lot
from
the
code
you
write
in
the
board
.
When
i
compar
my
code
with
your
i
can
learn
about
my
mistak
and
good
code
practic
that
i
should
follow
.
There
fore
i
think
it
would
be
great
if
we
can
discuss
more
exampl
in
the
class
.
